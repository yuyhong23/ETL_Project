"Indicator name: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture  Data Source: FAO (http://www.fao.org/), FAOSTAT Agriculture database(http://faostat3.fao.org/home/E)"
"Description: Total greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture contain all the emissions produced in the different agricultural emissions sub-domains, providing a picture of the contribution to the total amount of GHG emissions from agriculture. GHG emissions from agriculture consist of non-CO2 gases, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), produced by crop and livestock production and management activities."

"Description: Total greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture contain all the emissions produced in the different agricultural emissions sub-domains, providing a picture of the contribution to the total amount of GHG emissions from agriculture. GHG emissions from agriculture consist of non-CO2 gases, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), produced by crop and livestock production and management activities."
